	  			<h2>Bio</h2>
	  			<p>I'm currently a senior at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. I am majoring in Computer Science and want to be an entrepreneur. I hope to work for myself because I don't enjoy working for other people. 
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
				I recently moved to my own apartment. I no longer live through Stevens housing. This is really nice because I have my own room. My apartment is close to the PATH station which makes going to New York City easy. Going to class takes about 15 minutes.</p>
